- Hi, I’m @ranjukhanal11 and this is my last semester in ECU
- I’m interested in learning coding and different sectors of computer
- I’m currently in class data process visualization
- I’m looking to collaborate on some projects related to this course so I have chosen data visualization part but havent decided the particular topic on it.
- I am going to graduate in Spring 2022 and very excited to work in this field
